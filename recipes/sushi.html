    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This fresh pear salad with dried cranberries, cheese, almonds 
      and pecans is sensational in fall and winter months. "Made this salad for a 
      family gathering," says home cook Susan. "Had to double the recipe but it turned out that 
      I should have tripled it, everyone wanted more. It was absolutely delicious!"
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheet</li>
      <li>½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked    </li>
      <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
      <li>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>Step1:</h3>
    <m>
        Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)
    </m>
    <h3>Step2:</h3>
    <m>
        Bring water to a boil in a medium pot;
        stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, 
        and simmer until rice is tender and water has been
         absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
    </m>   
    <h3>Step3:</h3>
    <m>
        Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small
         bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.

    <h3>Step4:</h3>
    <m>
        Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.

    </m>   
    <h3>Step6:</h3>
    <m>
        Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands
         to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the
          crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.
           Lift one end of the mat and roll it
         tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
    </m>   
    <h3>Step7:</h3>
    Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.
