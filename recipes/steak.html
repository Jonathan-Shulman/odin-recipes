    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This fresh pear salad with dried cranberries, cheese, almonds 
      and pecans is sensational in fall and winter months. "Made this salad for a 
      family gathering," says home cook Susan. "Had to double the recipe but it turned out that 
      I should have tripled it, everyone wanted more. It was absolutely delicious!"
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>(2 pound) flat iron steak</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
    </ul>





    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h3>Step1:</h3>
    <m>Place the steak inside of a large resealable bag. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil,
         garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper and mustard powder.
          Pour over the steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag.
         Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.
    </m>
    <h3>Step2:</h3>
    <m>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
         Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare,
          or to your desired degree of doneness. Discard the marinade.
        Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.
